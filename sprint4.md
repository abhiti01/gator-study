2. Then run `npm install`
3. npm should take care of installing all the dependencies, run `npm run dev` and the console should output the link at which the website is live (localhost:3000 or localhost:8000)
4. If npm doesn't install required dependencies correctly, try running `npm install next react react-dom`

#### Steps to run Frontend tests :
1. Inside gator-study-frontend, run `npm run cypress`
2. Click on 'Run integration tests'
3. To use Cypress in headless mode instead, run `npm run cypress:headless`
