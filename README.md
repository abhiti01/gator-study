# Gator-Study
## Description
This is our term project for CEN 5035, Software Engineering. This project will create a web-application that is a Pomodoro timer at its core with a focus on facilitating group study online. Users can use this app to study on their own or form a group to study with (similar to a server on Discord or Slack). The users have an option to chose a group they wish to study with. Once joined, they can chat with the members of the group in real time and see a timer to keep track of time. They can also play music from youtube and make personal notes while they are at it. 
## Problem Statement
Students use tools such as Twitch, Discord, and YouTube as a group study platform. While these platforms work, they are not built to facilitate group studying. With our app we wish to builde a platform which students can use as an all in one solution for group studying.
