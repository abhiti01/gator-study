## Description
This is our term project for CEN 5035, Software Engineering. This project will create a web-application that is a Pomodoro timer at its core with a focus on facilitating group study online. Users can use this app to study on their own or form a group to study with (similar to a server on Discord or Slack). 
## Feature List

 - [ ] A user can sign-up to use the application.
 - [ ] The student can then use the application as a simple Pomodoro timer.
 - [ ] The student can play and control music from YouTube/Spotify/Apple music via the web-app.
 - [ ] The student can pick between different calming effects to go along with the timer (such as Rain effects in the background).
 - [ ] The student can invite other students to join the study session. All the users will see the same Pomodoro timer.
 - [ ] The other students in the session can request the admin of the session to pause/play the Pomodoro timer.
 - [ ] The music picked by the session admin will play for all the students
 - [ ] All the students in the session can chat with each other to exchange notes and ideas.
