## Description
This is our term project for CEN 5035, Software Engineering. This project will create a web-application that is a Pomodoro timer at its core with a focus on facilitating group study online. Users can use this app to study on their own or form a group to study with (similar to a server on Discord or Slack).
## Problem Statement
Students use tools such as Twitch, Discord, and YouTube as a group study platform. While these platforms work, they are not built to facilitate group studying. With our app we wish to builde a platform which students can use as an all in one solution for group studying.
## Feature List

 - [x] A user can sign-up to use the application.
 - [x] The student can then use the application as a simple Pomodoro timer.
 - [x] The student can play and control music from YouTube/Spotify/Apple music via the web-app.
 - [ ] The student can pick between different calming effects to go along with the timer (such as Rain effects in the background).
 - [x] The student can join study sessions. All the users can access Pomodoro timer.
 - [ ] The other students in the session can request the admin of the session to pause/play the Pomodoro timer.
 - [ ] The music picked by the session admin will play for all the students
 - [x] All the students in the session can chat with each other to exchange notes and ideas.
